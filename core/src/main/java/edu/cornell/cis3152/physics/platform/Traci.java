/*
 * Traci.java
 *
 * This is the class for Traci Nathans-Kelly cartoon avatar. WHile it is also
 * an ObstacleSprite, this class is much more than an organizational tool. This
 * class has all sorts of logic, like the whether Traci can jump or whether
 * Traci can fire a bullet.
 *
 * You SHOULD NOT need to modify this file. However, you may learn valuable
 * lessons for the rest of the lab by looking at it.

/**
 * Traci's avatar for the platform game.
 *
 * An ObstacleSprite is a sprite (specifically a textured mesh) that is
 * connected to a obstacle. It is designed to be the same size as the
 * physics object, and it tracks the physics object, matching its position
 * and angle at all times.
 *
 * Note that unlike a traditional ObstacleSprite, this attaches some additional
 * information to the obstacle. In particular, we add a sensor fixture. This
  * sensor is used to prevent double-jumping. However, we only have one mesh,
 * the mesh for Traci. The sensor is invisible and only shows up in debug mode.
 * While we could have made the fixture a separate obstacle, we want it to be a
 * simple fixture so that we can attach it to the obstacle WITHOUT using joints.
